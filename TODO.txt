-   Currently works with a default classifier & data

-   Provide option to upload your own CLF via skops (secure persistence)

-   Try to provide better visualisations than just the current plots if possible or at least integrate
    it into the tool a bit better

-   Could perhaps have user supply scripts & manually inject skops dump after "...".fit(x_train, y_train)

-   With multiple dumps of the same clf type and data with varying hyperparameter, can implement
    a "slider" effect (i.e one dump for C = 0, one for C=0.2, 0.4 etc). This can be considerably time consuming
    unless done in parallel perhaps. Current trade off is retraining of the model

-   Look into directory scanning for user provided scripts/clf files (recommended)

-   Look into venv/way to allow different users to run this tool with different system environments.
    (Perhaps a requirements.txt too)

-   Ability to choose a dataset to load in (with appropriate checks to load in different types of sets).

-   Ability to recognise the type of data that has been inputted, with appropriate measures for each type
    i.e image, text, reg, wav
    (will potentially need to apply pipeline to allow for vectorisation, grayscaling etc).

-   Ability to choose data, Training/Test Split,
    Ability to choose CLF method, Hyperparameter Customisation/Grid Search
    (With good explanations for how each CLF works and the hyperparameters (We want to teach ML concepts
    at the end of the day!!!)).

-   Get more familiar with pyqt and try get better idea on how to retain information between widget transitions.

-   Make it intuitive to use, and provide adequate comments to guide people into using the tool.

-   Make it look a lot more pretty

-   Work is very cut out for me hence need to stay committed each day or two, very important before things get complicated
    with reports next semester.
