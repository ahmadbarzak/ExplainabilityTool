# Task for Caleb:
# 1: Load training data for image classification.

# 2: Apply SVM model using Scikit learn, choose hyperparameters
# at your own discretion, or via hyperparameter tuning e.g use gridsearch.

# 3: Apply Lime explainability object and try to plot the results
# for one particular prediction.

# 4: Investigate how you did this and whether you had to modify the
# structure of the model code to do task 3.

# 5: try multiple different predictions with lime and write what you find.

# 6: Extra for experts: Try using a different model such as bayes or xgboost/random forest
# and try see how your explainability evaluations change for the same image dataset and predictions.

# 7: Document the following: What parts of your code had to change to achieve this?
# Do you think this code can be easily swapped out for other models for example?
